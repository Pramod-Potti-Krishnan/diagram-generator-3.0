## 🚀 Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Prerequisites

- ✅ Railway account ([railway.app](https://railway.app))
- ✅ Supabase project with `diagram-charts` bucket configured
- ✅ Google Gemini API key

### 2. Deploy to Railway

```bash
# Option A: Deploy from GitHub
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
2. Railway auto-detects configuration
3. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard

# Option B: Deploy using CLI
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### 3. Required Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard → Variables:

```bash
# Required
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_BUCKET=diagram-charts
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
ENV=production
```

**Note**: Railway sets `PORT` automatically - don't set it manually!

### 4. Verify Deployment

Visit your Railway URL:
```
https://your-service.up.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "diagram_generator_v3",
  "conductor": "ready"
}
```

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Railway, ensure:

### Supabase Configuration
- [ ] Created `diagram-charts` storage bucket (public)
- [ ] Configured 4 RLS policies (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- [ ] Tested bucket locally with `python test_bucket.py`

### API Keys
- [ ] Have Supabase project URL
- [ ] Have Supabase anonymous key
- [ ] Have Google Gemini API key

### Local Testing
- [ ] Service runs locally: `python main.py`
- [ ] Health check works: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
- [ ] Diagram generation works: `python test_local_deployment.py`

---

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Locally First

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start server
python main.py

# In another terminal, run tests
python test_local_deployment.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Test 1: Service Information - PASSED
✅ Test 2: Health Check - PASSED
✅ Test 3: SVG Template Diagram - PASSED
✅ Test 4: Mermaid Flowchart - PASSED
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

### Test on Railway

After deployment, run same tests against Railway URL:

```bash
# Update test_local_deployment.py to use Railway URL
BASE_URL = "https://your-service.up.railway.app"

# Run tests
python test_local_deployment.py
```

## 🔧 Key Technical Details

### Port Configuration
- **Local**: Uses port `8080` by default
- **Railway**: Automatically uses Railway's `PORT` environment variable
- **Code**: `rest_server.py` checks `os.getenv("PORT", 8080)`

### Database Operations
- **Session tracking**: Optional, fails gracefully if tables don't exist
- **Metadata storage**: Optional, non-critical for diagram generation
- **Diagram upload**: Required, uses Supabase Storage bucket

### Graceful Degradation
The service works without database tables by:
1. Uploading diagrams to Supabase Storage (required)
2. Returning public URLs to diagrams
3. Skipping session and metadata tracking (optional features)
